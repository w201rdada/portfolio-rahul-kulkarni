# ## A beginning.
#
# The internet has democratized a lot of industries has had a transformational economic impact across the globe. But the internet infrastructure itself is not democratized, all internet users are not equal. The cost, network bandwidth and performance of the internet vary substantially across the globe. This poses significant challenges for businesses that rely on the global internet infrastucture for their daily business. This study aims to provide an analysis of the cost, bandwidth and a performance index to account for outages acorss the globe. This will help globally connected businesses with better insights in understanding the impact and implicaions to their business outcomes

# ## A middle.
#
# businesses depend on the internet for their daily operations. A lot of small businesses rely on the public internet to do business transactions worldwide. business applications hosted in a cloud need to interact with their clients across the world. Currently they rely on best-effort guarantees of the internet. Critical applications. example a CAD rendering done in Asia connected with a remote server hosted in USA relies on a vast internet infrastructure. An outage or a slowdown can have an impact on the business deliverable. Mobile phone applications which require heavy network bandwidth may have varied end-used experience depending on which part of the world they are being used from. To help understand this a internet analytics and prediction engine which can render the internet usage and map of the worldwide internet infrastructure will help businesses in understanding potential bottlences and pitfalls of thier network dependent critical applications.
#
# Use data science techniques to collect, analyze and predict worldwide internet infrastructure usage
#
# Use case 1:
#
# How is my mobile gaming app experience in 20 major cities of the world?  
#
# What is the solution - think of an interface (API) which can take a set of paramters about your application requriements
# and predict how it will perform across major cities of the world. 
#
# how does this API work - how can it predict potential performance of a mobile application in cities across the world?
#
#  
#  Use case 2:
#
#  When can my Car design business transfer large set of databases (Petabytes) from USA to a multiple global teams across the world?
#
#  Provide an API to simulate this tran—ïfer and preict best possible time of the day for this operation
