## A beginning.
Buisnesses depend on the internet for their daily operations. A lot of small buisnesses rely on tthe public internet to do buisness transactions worldwide. Buisness applications hosted in a cloud need to interact with their clients across the world. Currently they rely on best-effort garantees of the internet to be available with the right bandwidth, performance and latency requirements for buisness critical applications. example a CAD rendering done in Asia connected with a remote server hosted in USA relies on a vast internet infrastructure. An outage or a slowdown can have an impact on the buisness deliverable. Mobile phone applications which require heavy network bandwidth may have varied end-used experience depending on which part of the world they are being used from. To help understand this a internet analytics and prediction engine which can render the internet usage and map of the worldwide internet infrastructure will help buisnesses in understanding potential bottlences and pitfalls of thier network dependent critical applications.


## A middle.

Use data science techniques to collect, analyze and predict worldwide internet infrastructure usage

## An end.

Provide this data to corelate buisness outcomes with internet usage and availability worldwide will help buisnesses which rely on the internet for their critical operations
