### Abstract of my first cool idea {-}

The Internet has democratized a lot of industries and has had a transformational economic impact across the globe. But the internet infrastructure itself is not democratized, all internet users are not equal. The cost, network bandwidth and performance of the internet vary substantially across the globe. This poses significant challenges for businesses that rely on the global internet infrastructure for their business. This research aims to apply data science techniques to analyze the cost, bandwidth and a performance index of internet connectivity across major global regions. This will help globally connected businesses with better insights in understanding the impact and implications to their business outcomes.
